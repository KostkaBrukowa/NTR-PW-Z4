## Backed
To run the application first start the .net Core application using VSCode or Rider (which i personally used). To do so go to `backend` folder and open with your editor and run application

## Frontend
To start the frontend application go to frontend folder and type
```
yarn && yarn start
```
or if you use `npm` type
```
npm i && npm run start
```

And you should have running application.
